## HistoricalDate

The HistoricalDate gem provides a way to parse and use incomplete dates, like those found in history or genealogy.

For example, if you know your great-great-great grandmother was born in April, 1836, but you don't know the day of the month, that's not going to work if you try to parse it as a Date object.

With HistoricalDate, when you parse an incomplete date, you'll be given a hash of information about the date that can be stored as a string.
